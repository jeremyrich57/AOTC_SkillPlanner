combat_smuggler_combat_02, It isn't fun to get shot at and Smugglers know this more than anyone.  You don't have to hit your target to make them duck long enough for you to get away.  The /panicshot command lets you delay your enemies next action while you plan yours.
combat_smuggler_combat_03, When you're in a life or death situation, honor has to take a back seat to survival.  Shooting for the knees or the groin might not be honorable, but it'll give you the chance to get out of harm's way.  Using the /lowblow command, you can knock your opponent down for a little while.
combat_smuggler_combat_04, Nothing is more dangerous than a cornered smuggler with a trusted blaster.

Smugglers are often hired by third parties to move large shipments of spice through Republic and Separatist blockades.
combat_smuggler_spice_02, Some medical and industrial chemicals can be used as physical enhancements...occasionally with dangerous side effects.  These materials are closely controlled by the Empire.  Smugglers have found it profitable to help make these chemicals more widely available.
combat_smuggler_spice_03, Some medical and industrial chemicals can be used as physical enhancements...occasionally with dangerous side effects.  These materials are closely controlled by the Empire.  Smugglers have found it profitable to help make these chemicals more widely available.
combat_smuggler_spice_04, Some forms of spice have radical and powerful effects on humanoid physiology.

Smugglers able to get their hands on shipments of high quality 'Chems' can find buyers among the rich and powerful.
combat_smuggler_underworld_01, A Smuggler deals with aliens every day, negotiating the finer points of a contract legal and otherwise.  This requires both good negotiation skills and the ability to understand the languages of the parties involved.  This skill grants the ability to understand most languages spoken in the galaxy.  It also reduces the cost of all faction perks by 10% for the smuggler.
combat_smuggler_underworld_02, When things get desperate the best way to get out of trouble isn't with a gun: it's with fast talking.  With this skill, a Smuggler loses only half the normal faction penalty for dying in PvP combat.  (The smuggler saves face by convincing his friends it was all a misunderstanding.)  The Smuggler is also only worth half the normal faction award.
combat_smuggler_underworld_03, A Smuggler is motivated by two things: survival and profit.  Sometimes it's necessary to change sides in a conflict to achieve those goals.  With the "Selling Out" skill, a Smuggler can trade faction points for cash at any opposing faction recruiter.
combat_smuggler_underworld_04, A Smuggler's work puts him in contact with a lot of people in high places.  A Smuggler can draw upon these connections to improve his standing with various organizations....at a price.
combat_smuggler_weapons_04, A Smuggler needs every edge they can get: in negotiation and in battle.  A choice weapon modifiation can lend the extra punch needed to convince an adversary that your price is acceptable.  At the Slicing IV skill level, the smuggler can jury rig a weapon to suit their personal tactical needs.
